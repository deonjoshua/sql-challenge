# sql-challenge
In this challenge I had to do a research project about people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remained of the employee database from that period were six CSV files.
For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. That is data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

# Data Modelling
Inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an ERD of the tables using QuickDBD.

# Data Engineering
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files by - 
Specifying the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. And then importing each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
